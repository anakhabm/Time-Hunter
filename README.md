# Time-Hunter
This is my first android application built using kotlin as a part of 30 Days Of Kotlin campaign hosted by Google.
Time Hunter is a simple android gaming application that supports variuos android platforms. This is a frenzy game that tests the user's speed, accuracy and mental curiosity as you race against time. 
You can start the game by tapping the button on the centre of the screen,you then have 60 seconds to tap the same button as many times as you can. Each tap increases youe score by 1.When you run out of time,the app will notify you of your score and then the game is reset.
